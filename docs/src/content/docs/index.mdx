## Why Trusted Base Images?

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Three-Actor Governance" icon="shield">
		Build, Review, and Release are performed by isolated actors with separate signing keys. No single actor can push an unverified image to production.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Signed Attestations" icon="approve-check">
		Every image ships with SBOM (SPDX), CVE scan (Grype), and SLSA v1.0 provenance attestations, each cryptographically signed and verifiable with cosign.
	</Card>
	<Card title="CVE Monitoring" icon="warning">
		Automated vulnerability scanning with OPA policy enforcement. Images exceeding critical or high CVE thresholds are quarantined, never promoted to trusted.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Digest Pinning" icon="puzzle">
		Every build is pinned to upstream per-architecture manifest digests. Tags are mutable, digests are not — ensuring reproducible, tamper-evident builds.
	</Card>
	<Card title="OCI Annotations" icon="information">
		Standard OCI labels plus custom Infrashift labels provide full traceability: upstream base, digest, variant, build date, git revision, and architecture.
	</Card>
