description: How to download evidence artifacts and verify their integrity using SHA-256 checksums.
---

Every build produces an evidence bundle containing the SBOM, CVE report, and provenance artifacts. Each artifact is individually signed, and a signed checksum manifest ties them all together.

## Evidence Bundle Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sbom.json` | SPDX SBOM generated by Syft |
| `sbom.json.sig` | cosign signature of the SBOM |
| `cve-report.json` | Grype vulnerability scan results |
| `cve-report.json.sig` | cosign signature of the CVE report |
| `provenance.json` | SLSA v1.0 build provenance |
| `provenance.json.sig` | cosign signature of the provenance |
| `checksums.sha256` | SHA-256 checksums of all artifacts |
| `checksums.sha256.sig` | cosign signature of the checksum file |

## Download Evidence

Evidence bundles are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts. Download them from the build run:

```bash
# Using the gh CLI
gh run download <run-id> --name evidence-ubi9-standard-amd64 --dir evidence/
```

## Verify Checksums

```bash
cd evidence/
sha256sum --check checksums.sha256
```

Expected output:

```
sbom.json: OK
sbom.json.sig: OK
cve-report.json: OK
cve-report.json.sig: OK
provenance.json: OK
provenance.json.sig: OK
```

## Verify Checksum Signature

Download the Build-Actor's public key and verify the checksum file itself was signed by the build:

```bash
curl -sSfL -o build.pub \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infrashift/trusted-base-oci-images/main/.github/pdp/public-keys/build.pub

cosign verify-blob \
  --key build.pub \
  --insecure-ignore-tlog \
  --signature checksums.sha256.sig \
  checksums.sha256
```

## Verify Individual Artifact Signatures

Each evidence artifact is also individually signed:

```bash
for artifact in sbom.json cve-report.json provenance.json; do
  echo "Verifying ${artifact}..."
  cosign verify-blob \
    --key build.pub \
    --insecure-ignore-tlog \
    --signature "${artifact}.sig" \
    "${artifact}"
done
```

## Trust Chain

The checksum verification establishes:

1. **Integrity** — The artifacts have not been modified since the build produced them
2. **Authenticity** — The checksums were signed by the Build-Actor's sovereign key
3. **Completeness** — All expected artifacts are present and match their recorded checksums
